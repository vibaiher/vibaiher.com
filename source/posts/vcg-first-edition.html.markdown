### What is VCG?

**VCG** is the acronym for “Ver Conferéncias Grabadas”, a bad name but an excellent initiative.
It consists in collecting some talks from other conferences and then, during the conference, attendants can vote them and the most voted ones are watched and argued.

### The First Edition

This is the list of videos that we saw in the first edition:

- [**Not Just Code Monkeys**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8aECe4lp44) by **Martin Fowler** at *OOP 2014*.
- [**How to Build a Skyscraper**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MeBuDLbF98) by **Ernie Miller** at *Full Stack Fest 2015*.
- [**Connascence & Coupling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2o4vbAK3s) by **Joss Robb** at *Codemania 2015*.
- [**Nothing is Something**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) by **Sandi Metz** at *RailsConf 2015*.
- [**The Future of Programming**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4) by **Bret Victor** at *DBX Conference*.
- [**Hunters and Gatherers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahh-QkttjuM) by **Paolo Perrotta** at *Baruco 2013*.
- [**The Rapid Software Testing Guide to What You Meant To Say**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnsfLYgn3I) by **Michael Bolton** at *TestBash 2015*.
- [**The Economy of Keystrokes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_yj4k4QZVI) by **Kyle Simpson** at *Thunder Plains 2015*.

#### [Not Just Code Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8aECe4lp44)

It’s about the moral and ethics as software developers, dark patterns, privacy and some other topics that we should think about.

#### [How to Build a Skyscraper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MeBuDLbF98)

I proposed this one but nobody argued anything at end. Maybe its not as controversial as the first one, but I liked it because it shows a lot of problems related with software projects only talking about the history of skyscrapers.

#### [Connascence & coupling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2o4vbAK3s)

Sincerely I need to view this talk again. It's about coupling and cohesion, and a software metic called [Connascence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connascence_(computer_programming)). This metric allows us to talk about the relation of two objects and the complexity of this relation. I’m sure this metic will appear in the next [Flywire](https://twitter.com/flywireeng)’s code reviews…

#### [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE)

I enjoy Sandi Metz's talks always, and this one is not an exception. In this talk, she talks about Active Nothing (Null Object Pattern), inheritance and composition with very good examples.

#### [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)

I really liked this one. Bret Victor staged that he was in 1973 giving a talk about the future of programming. He talked about a lot of computer science knowledge that we had in 1973 and nowadays it hasn't been applied yet. I have been thinking about learning about functional programming, reactive programming, actor models, etc… and this talk makes me think that this is the right way.

#### [Hunters and Gatherers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahh-QkttjuM)

This talk is about the same topic than previous one, but it uses some really great examples of science advantages. There is a good #protip here: “strong opinions, weakly held”.

#### [The Rapid Software Testing Guide to What You Meant To Say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYnsfLYgn3I)

This one is about how you communicate with others. It’s from a tester perspective but it can be extrapolated to any field. If you are a developer and you think you don’t need a tester role in your team, I encourage you to see this talk because at the end you will change your opinion.

#### [The Economy of Keystrokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_yj4k4QZVI)

This was an interesting talk. At the beginning he talked a bit about discriminations in our field. A field when if you are white, male, studied and american you have some advantages over others. It would be nice to beat this things as soon as possible… The rest of the talk can be summarized in “readers > writers”. You should write code thinking that anyone later should be able to understand what you are doing and specially why you are doing this.

### And that’s all folks

* **15** attendants.
* **8** videos.
* **1** paella.
* Some **ping-pong** and **table soccer** games played.

Although we only argued about some of them, I think all of us learned something at the end so, at least for me, it was a pleasure to attend and I expect we can repeat this type of conference soon.

### Credits

Special thanks to:

* [Edu Saborit](https://twitter.com/esaborit4code) for having this nice initiative.
* All attendants for adding his videos and arguing in a constructive way.
* [Flywire](https://twitter.com/flywireeng) for gave his office up to us.

**And also thanks to the real conferences and speakers for uploading all this awesome talks!**
